# Normalized Peak Plot of Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over last 15 recessions
The code in this repository allows the user to create a normalized peak plot of the Dow Jones Industrial average over the last 15 recessions, from the Great Depression (Aug. 1929 to Mar. 1933) to the current COVID-19 recession (likely started in March 2020). A normalized peak plot takes the maximum level of the DJIA at the beginning of a recession (within two months of the NBER declared beginning month) and normalizes the entire series so that the value at that peak equals 1.0. As such, the normalized time series shows the percent change from that peak. This is an intuitive way to compare the progression of average stock prices across recessions. The following figure is the normalized peak plot of the DJIA from May 29, 2020.
